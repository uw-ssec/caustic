# caustics

## Getting Started

Welcome to the lensing pipeline of the future: GPU-accelerated, automatically-differentiable,
highly modular. Currently under heavy development: expect interface changes and
some imprecise/untested calculations.

## Installation 

Simply install caustics from PyPI:
```bash
pip install caustics
```

## Documentation

Please see our [documentation page](Ciela-Institute.github.io/caustics/) for more detailed information.
